<p style="text-align: justify;">
The group focuses on the development of computational algorithms and advanced numerical methods for modeling and simulation of fluid dynamics in porous media in general. These computational tools can be used for the simulation and modeling of saturated and unsaturated aquifers, contaminant transport and groundwater, oil reservoir simulation, heat transference and waste depositional . In addition, these tools can be used for the simulation and modeling of oil reservoir. These simulations provide detailed information about the behavior of aquifers and reservoirs that help hydrologists and researchers make the best management decisions.

In this figure we see the contaminant transporte in one dimensional problem, considering that the porous media is isotropic and homogeneous.
